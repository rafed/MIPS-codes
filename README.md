# MIPS-codes
This repository contains some basic MIPS assembly language codes. Better to run them using the MARS MIPS simulator as some of the programs uses the MARS syscalls.

Codes in the repository:

1. Matrix multiplication - multiply two matrices

2. Printing rectangles - prints rectangles with dots after a definite time interval

3. Histogram - takes a string input, counts each character and creates a histogram. The histogram is the rotated 180 degrees.

4. Gaussian elimination - solves a linear system with the gaussian elimination techinique. This code might have some errors (may fail where there are more than three variables)
